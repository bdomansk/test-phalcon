# Phalcon Skeleton

**Overview**

The purpose of this repository is to give a skeleton app that has the basic 
things done. It's extremely basic and for explanation purposes but at a 
state that can be extended into an app.

---


## app/

* The app directory holds everything for the backend of the application - all 
the business and view logic. A place where users cannot browse to.

## public/

* The public directory holds everything that can be browsed by a user. Typically
holds CSS, JS, and images.

## app_config.php

* This holds all your application configuration.
